# Plant Disease Prediction using Machine Learning ðŸŒ±

## Description
This project predicts plant diseases using machine learning and computer vision techniques. It uses a dataset of plant leaf images, preprocesses the images, trains a model, and provides an interface for users to upload leaf images to get disease predictions.

## Features
- Image preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment using streamlit
- User-friendly web interface

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
